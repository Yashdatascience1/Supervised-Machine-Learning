# An ML model to predict the CTC to be offered to a new candidate

## **Problem Statement**
To ensure there is no discrimination between employees, it is imperative for the Human Resources
department of Delta Ltd. to maintain a salary range for each employee with similar profiles
Apart from the existing salary, there is a considerable number of factors regarding an employeeâ€™s
experience and other abilities to which they get evaluated in interviews. Given the data related to
individuals who applied in Delta Ltd, models can be built that can automatically determine salary
which should be offered if the prospective candidate is selected in the company. This model seeks to
minimize human judgment with regard to salary to be offered.

The objective of this exercise is to build a model, using historical data that will
determine an employee's salary to be offered, such that manual judgments on selection are
minimized. It is intended to have a robust approach and eliminate any discrimination in salary
among similar employee profiles

## **My solution**

A regression model was created after carefully exploring the data, assessing the patterns, cleaning the data, and preparing the data to be fed into a regression
model.

Several models were tested including Tree based models, Linear regression, Support Vector machines
